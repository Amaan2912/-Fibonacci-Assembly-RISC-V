# -Fibonacci-Assembly-RISC-V
Built a RISC-V program to parse ASCII input, convert to integer, and compute (F_n) using an iterative fibo procedure. Added overflow detection logic to return safe error values for out-of-range Fibonacci results. Utilized RARS system calls for string input and formatted output following calling-convention standards.
